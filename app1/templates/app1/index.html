							<h2><strong><u>HISTORY</u></strong></h2>
							<p>
								This thought evolved with the Criminologist and Sociologist Edwin H. Sutherland, in the  year 1939,
								who popularised the term white collar crimes‘ by defining such a crime as one
								committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his
								occupation. Sutherland also included crimes committed by corporations and other legal
								entities within his definition. Sutherland‘s study of white collar crime was prompted by the
								view that criminology had incorrectly focused on social and economic determinants of crime,
								such as family background and level of wealth.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							It was first defined by the sociologist Edwin Sutherland in 1939 as
							"a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of their occupation".
							Typical white-collar crimes could include wage theft, fraud, bribery, Ponzi schemes, insider trading, labor racketeering, embezzlement, cybercrime, copyright infringement, money laundering, identity theft, and forgery.
							White-collar crime overlaps with corporate crime.
